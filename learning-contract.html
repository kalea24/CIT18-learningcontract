        <h2><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Hindrances</h2>
        <p>Potential challenges include balancing the depth of learning with project deadlines, especially when working on other initiatives with limited resources. I may encounter knowledge gaps that require additional research and mentorship to overcome. Technical constraints such as browser compatibility issues or performance limitations with complex visual effects could also present obstacles. Additionally, managing multiple project folders and codebases while maintaining consistent quality across different components requires disciplined organization and time management strategies.</p>
